# 2018-03-29 Bug Fixes 
This document outlines the feedback received on 2018-03-29 for the scheduling tool.

## ~~Add Button Not Responding~~
* *Description:* Add button would not respond after waiting ~30-120 seconds
* Error was occuring while trying to add report 'Chrio Claims With No Manipulations' & 'Aging Claims All LOB'
* These reports have no parameters which in my testing is throwing up the modal saying please add a report

## Not Accepting Multiple Parameters
* *Description:* There was no way to select multiple parameters from a dropdown list
* Issue occured while adding parameters to the report 'Claims By EXCD'
* **This is something that has yet to be implemented**


## ~~String was not recognized as a valid DateTime Server Error~~
* *Description:* Adding a schedule where the start time minutes is a single digit will cause a `System.FormatException`
* This error is thrown due to the fact that it's expecting a double digit such as '00' or '01' for the minutes rather than '0' or '1' respectively 
* This can be implemented nicely with the following: 
```csharp
if (int.Parse(minutes) < 10 && minutes.Length == 1) {
    minutes = "0" + minutes; 
}
```


## Fixes Implemented
* Fixed issue that caused a System.FormatException when the user passed in a single digit for minutes
* Fixed issue that prevented user from adding reports that have no parameters
* Added error handling for report parameters to make sure all are specified 
* Added error handling for jQuery DataTables. Will only change the layout of DataTables if they exist in that particular context
